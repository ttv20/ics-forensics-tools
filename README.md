# [Microsoft Section52 ICS Forensics tools](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/iot-defender/)

## INTRODUCTION
Microsoft Section52 ICS Forensics Tools is an open source forensic toolkit for analyzing
Industrial PLC metadata and project files. Microsoft Section52 ICS Forensics Tools enables
investigators to identify suspicious artifacts on ICS environment for detection of compromised devices
during incident response or manual check. Microsoft Section52 ICS Forensics Tools is
open source, which allows investigators to verify the actions of
the tool or customize it to specific needs, currently support Siemens S7 via Snap7.

## SUPPORTED LOGICS
- OB usage
- Block author
- Offline - Online comparison
- Call Graphs
- Timestamps outliers
- Network usage

## Executing and arguments

This tool requires Python 3.8 or later.

### Install required Python packages
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Executing examples:
	 ./main.py -i 192.168.88.1 -la
	 ./main.py -i 192.168.88.1 -pn 220 -la
	 ./main.py -ci 192.168.88.1 -co -opd '\s7_proj' -opdn '\s7_proj'


### Output:
Depending on the model you choose to investigate, the data presented per model
- Upload project from PLC and parsing status
- Author block names and uniqueness -

The output includes 3 sections for each test:
1. raw data - all the data we search in.
2. suspicious - things we found out as suspicious - should be checked if they are legitimate or malicious.
3. recommendation - things we found out as weak security points and recommendations for fixing them.

##Resources and Technical data & solution:
[Microsoft Defender for IoT](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/iot-defender/#overview) is an agentless network-layer security solution that allows
organizations to continuously monitor and discover assets, detect threats, and manage vulnerabilities in their IoT/OT
and Industrial Control Systems (ICS) devices, on-premises and in Azure-connected environments.
